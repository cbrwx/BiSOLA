# BiSOLA: Bi-objective Self-Organizing Layered Architecture for Multi-Task Learning
BiSOLA (Bi-objective Self-Organizing Layered Architecture) is a multi-task learning architecture developed for the flexible and efficient training of machine learning models. Our approach leverages the principles of evolutionary algorithms to facilitate model optimization in a multi-task learning environment. The architecture is adaptive and self-organizing, enhancing its performance through an iterative process of mutation, crossover, and selection.

## Key Features
Adaptive Architecture:
BiSOLA adjusts its architecture during training to better adapt to the training data. This is accomplished through the addition of new layers when the model's performance is below a set threshold. This feature is particularly valuable in dynamic learning environments where the data or tasks may change over time.

### Self-Organizing Layered Architecture:
In addition to the adaptive architecture, the model organizes its layers to achieve improved performance. This is done by removing, changing layer types, and reordering layers in the model. This self-organization is achieved through an evolutionary process, allowing the architecture to explore a broad range of configurations, and thereby enhancing its ability to capture and model complex patterns in the data.

### Multi-Task Learning:
BiSOLA is designed to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. It can work with different models for different tasks, allowing it to handle a wide range of learning problems. Each model in the population can be trained on a specific task, thereby making the architecture highly flexible and versatile.

### Evolutionary Algorithm Approach:
BiSOLA employs an evolutionary algorithm approach for model optimization. It uses mutation, crossover, and selection operations to generate a new population of models in each generation. This approach allows BiSOLA to effectively search the model space and improve the model performance iteratively.

### Parallel Execution:
To expedite the training process, BiSOLA has been designed to leverage the power of parallel computing. It is capable of training multiple models simultaneously by utilizing Python's multiprocessing module and the Pool class, thus substantially reducing the total training time.

## Datasets
BiSOLA can work with a variety of data types. The provided example implementation assumes image and time-series data, with Conv1D and LSTM layers used for these data types, respectively. However, the architecture can be easily modified to handle different types of data as required. It is crucial to ensure that the initial model creation matches the data types, and the shape of the inputs matches the actual input data shapes.

## Dependencies
To use BiSOLA, the following dependencies are required:
```
Python 3
Keras
TensorFlow
Numpy
Multiprocessing (standard Python library)
```
## How to use BiSOLA
To use BiSOLA, create an instance of the BiSOLA class, providing the required parameters such as input dimension, number of tasks, and population size. Then, call the fit method to train the models on your data. You can optionally set the parallel parameter to True to enable parallel training.

In the training process, the population of models will evolve over a series of generations. Each model in the population will be trained on each task, and then modified through a series of operations - adaptive architecture, self-organization, mutation, and finally, a new population will be generated using the crossover operation.

Please note that the success of the training process largely depends on the problem at hand and the fine-tuning of these operations. As with any machine learning algorithm, it might require some trial and error to get the best results.

## Limitations
While the architecture has been designed to be highly versatile and adaptive, there are certain limitations to consider:

Parallel Execution Constraints: Although the architecture is designed to run in parallel, you must ensure that your system is adequately set up to handle multiprocessing. Note that the Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) might restrict parallel execution to a single core for computation-heavy tasks. Therefore, hardware constraints might limit the effective speedup that can be achieved through parallel execution.

Memory Constraints: Given that BiSOLA maintains a population of models and generates new models during its execution, it may require substantial memory resources for larger populations or complex models.

Non-convex Optimization Space: As with any machine learning model, the optimization space in BiSOLA is non-convex, which implies that the architecture might end up in local optima, and might require multiple runs or different initialization parameters to achieve the best results.

Dependence on Hyperparameters: The performance of the architecture is influenced by a number of hyperparameters such as the population size, the threshold for adaptive architecture changes, and the selection strategy. Finding the optimal set of hyperparameters might require systematic hyperparameter tuning.
